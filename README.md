# Exploring Correlates of War Data

Update (March 19, 2020): MySQL database schema for integrating MID and MIDLOC datasets is available as **create_mysql_db.sql**. (Has not been tested with the most recent version of the MIDLOC data, released January 6, 2020.)

Update (November 3, 2019): You can download all available CoW data sets at once (in .csv format) by running **collect_csv_data.py** in Python 3. Extraction of .csv files from .zip archives on CoW servers is performed automatically. Data files will be saved locally in the Resources/ folder of the current working directory.

**NOTICE: All data sets referenced in this GitHub repository are the intellectual property of the Correlates of War Project (http://correlatesofwar.org). Official copies of all CoW data sets, along with terms of use, are publicly available at http://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets. By using code in this repository to view or download these data sets, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the CoW Project's terms of use.**
